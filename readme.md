# Discord Bot

My first attempt at a Discord Bot

## Commands

```!hello```  
Bot says hello to the user that invoked the command

```!randomuseless```  

Bot sends a random fact from https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/

```!dailyuseless```  

Bot sends the daily fact from https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/

```!randomcat```

Bot sends a picture of a random cat from The Cat API

```!randomdog```

Bot sends a picture of a random dog from The Dog API

```!helpme```  

Bot sends one of two meme edits of a scene of the character Seihai-Kun from the anime Carnival Phantasm.

```!artofwar```  

Bot sends a random quote from the Art of War. Credit for the quotes.json file used goes to github:mattdesl

```!dice [X]```  

Bot sends a value between 1 and X, inclusive. Truncates non-integers, does not work with negative values.

```!copy [Y]```  

Bot sends the message Y

## To-Do List
- Center meme text
- try making wish flicker between two versions
- Get weather given some information
- Something that checks for reactions, deletes message
